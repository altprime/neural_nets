In this project you'll get to see a very basic overview of building an LSTM(RNN) model to predict stock prices. The accuracy was low but by hyperparameter tuning you can achieve a higher accuracy. This is just a bare bones LSTM structure. Feel free to copy this and play around: add a few more layers, change the epoch and batch size, etc.

The data will be available in the <b>./dataset/</b> folder. In the next few days I will be working on a similar project which will be more detailed and comprehensive and I'll make sure to link it here.
